    <strong class="label">What beginners should bring with them:</strong>
    <p>
        For starters - there should be two of you in the car: a driver, and a navigator (who isn't inclined to get car-sick reading while moving, or has an antidote for it). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Bring a mechanically sound car* that has a tenths -reading odometer (a resettable trip odometer can be a help), a clipboard, a four function calculator, several working pens, a set of highlighters (for marking up the route instructions) and post-it notes.  
    </p>
    <p>
        If you can choose between a mechanical odometer that "rolls" and a digital display, the     mechanical will enable you to interpolate to the hundredths. If you only have the digital tenths, then you'll have to do a lot more "guessing" in between the numbers clicking over. We have folks who have gotten good at this with practice! 
    </p>
    <p>
        While every team has their own procedure, it's useful to be able to highlight things like speed changes, and free zones (remember - there is a tutorial to get you started!) so that "on the road" it helps you remember them better.  The post-its are to stick on your dashboard to remind the driver of the assigned speeds and what the active course following priorities are.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Also - having a good map of the area that includes secondary (and tertiary roads) can be very helpful if you get lost and can't regain the rally course. 
    </p>
    <p>
        *While a cell phone and a AAA membership can't hurt, a lot of the time, we'll be traveling on roads that are well off the beaten track, and you may not have much of a description of where you are!  "Well - we got here by turning left after "Snodgrass", then right at T, and left by protection... "  While a GPS unit probably wonâ€™t help you very much while running the rally, it may be very useful for telling AAA where you are if you break down.
    </p>
